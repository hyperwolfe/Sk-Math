# Sk-Cuts
Skript addon for new shortcut syntax with optimizations to run as good or sometimes even better than skript!

Syntax for v1.1.0: 

%number% += %number%  
%number% -= %number%  
%number% *= %number%  
%number% /= %number%  
%number% ^= %number%  
%number/boolean/string% == %number/boolean/string%

Please don't redistribute as your own (illegal)!
